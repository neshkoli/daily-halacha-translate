Good morning.
From the days between the straits [Three Weeks], it is customary in most communities of Israel not to get married... not to get married during the days between the straits. Regarding engagement ceremonies (Erusin), what we call Erusin, the more correct name for it from a Halachic perspective is actually a "shidduch" (matchmaking). 
Because what Halacha calls Erusin is the giving of the ring that we do right before the wedding, under the chuppah. 
So regarding Erusin, what we call it, or rather, again, it's called shidduchim (matchmaking), this will be permitted even during the Three Weeks and even during the Nine Days. 
The meaning of this is that they establish the decision of the couple to get married. 
Usually, the parents also meet, one with the other. 
However, the engagement party (Erusin party), where one wants to celebrate this decision, then the celebration must be postponed until after the Three Weeks. 
The reason for these customs is twofold. Firstly, because, as we have said several times, there is mourning, and therefore we do not want to hold large celebrations, neither for weddings nor for engagement celebrations, during these weeks. In addition, since we have already said that this time is a time that is considered a time with a bad sign, with bad luck. Therefore, we do not want to do something like a wedding, which must be at a good sign and with good luck, we do not want to do it at a time that is considered a time that is less good for the Jewish people. 
And for these reasons, they postpone the celebrations and the weddings until after the Three Weeks.
