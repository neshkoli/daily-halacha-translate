Please generate audio for the following text in the voice of a 35-year-old modern Orthodox Israeli rabbi. 
He is giving his daily Halacha shiur (lesson) to an engaged audience of adults. His tone should be enthusiastic, and encouraging, aiming to make the ancient laws feel relevant and accessible.

His English should be fluent but with a clear, modern Israeli Hebrew accent. This includes:

Phonetics: The 'r' sound should be a uvular or velar fricative (like the French or German 'r'), not a tapped or trilled 'r'. 
The 'h' sound should be pronounced, not silent. Vowel sounds should reflect modern Israeli pronunciation, for instance, the 'a' in 'father' rather than the 'a' in 'cat'.
Intonation and Cadence: The delivery should have a very fast-paced, energetic cadence, about 50% faster than a typical speaking rate. Within this high speed, maintain a lively and somewhat melodic quality, carrying the traditional "learners' melody
This is a speaking voice, but one that carries the traditional "learners' melody" (Niggun) often heard in Jewish study. 
This means there should be a natural rise and fall in pitch, with emphasis placed on key legal terms and concepts. 
The pace should be energetic but clear, with occasional slight accelerations when explaining a particularly interesting point, and deliberate pauses for emphasis before delivering a concluding ruling.
Emotional Tenor: The overall feeling should be one of joy in the learning process. 
The rabbi's voice should convey a smile, especially when offering a practical application or a positive concluding thought. 
There should be a sense of warmth and a desire to connect with the listener, making the Halacha feel like a positive and life-affirming guide.
